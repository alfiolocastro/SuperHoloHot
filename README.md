# SuperHoloHot

In the last  few days I've put my hands on a Hololens2. I loved SuperHOT (pc, console, VR) and I was curious to see how that would be like in the real life, it's a thing I want to do since the very first augmented reality devices were accessible.
I think Hololens is a perfect fit for this purpouse (hands free, a decent GPU, a very good spatial perception and understanding) and this video https://youtu.be/1pQrcX15480 shows what I got after a day of [spare time] development using Unity3d and MRTK.

The idea is to make a "complete" game with level editor and fully playable in every context (room, open spaces)
